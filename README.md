Heart Disease Prediction using Logistic Regression
This repository contains a project for predicting heart disease using logistic regression. The project involves data preprocessing, splitting the data into training and testing sets, and evaluating the model's accuracy.

Project Overview
Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death globally. Early detection can save lives, and machine learning models can aid in predicting the likelihood of heart disease based on various medical features. This project uses logistic regression, a simple yet effective algorithm, to build a predictive model for heart disease.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is heart_disease_data.csv. It contains several medical features like age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol levels, etc., which are used to predict the target variable target, indicating the presence or absence of heart disease.
